## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- A Google API Key (free tier available)

### Step 1: Get Your Free Google API Key

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click **"Create API Key"**
4. Copy your API key (keep it safe!)

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Clone or download this project
cd eco-travel

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Configure Your API Key

For security, the API key is loaded from an environment file.

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Open the `.env` file and add your actual API key:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```
3. **Note:** The `.gitignore` file is already configured to ensure your `.env` file is never uploaded to GitHub.

### Step 4: Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Enter Origin City**: Type your starting location (e.g., "Bangalore")
2. **Enter Destination City**: Type where you want to go (e.g., "Mysore")
3. **Set Number of Travelers**: Adjust the count (1-50)
4. **Click "Calculate Sustainability"**: Get your results!

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Emission Factors Used

| Transport Mode | Emission Factor |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Personal Car (Petrol) | 0.19 kg CO₂/km/vehicle |
| Public Bus | 0.089 kg CO₂/km/passenger |
| Electric Vehicle | 0.05 kg CO₂/km/vehicle |
| Train | 0.041 kg CO₂/km/passenger |

### API Configuration

The app uses Google Gemini 1.5 Flash with:
- Low temperature (0.2) for consistent results
- Structured JSON output format
- Strict prompt engineering to prevent hallucination

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "API Error" message
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure you haven't exceeded API rate limits

### "No valid JSON found in response"
- Try a different city combination
- The AI occasionally needs retry for unusual routes

### App won't start
- Ensure Python 3.9+ is installed: `python --version`
- Verify all dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 📝 Running in Google Colab

To run in Colab, create a new notebook and run:

```python
# Install dependencies
!pip install streamlit google-generativeai python-dotenv

# Create the app file (copy contents of app.py)
%%writefile app.py
# <paste entire app.py content here>

# Run with localtunnel
!npm install -g localtunnel
!streamlit run app.py &>/dev/null&
!lt --port 8501
```
